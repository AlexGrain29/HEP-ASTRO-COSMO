## Tools

### Root

ROOT is a framework for data processing, born at CERN, at the heart of the research on high-energy physics.

### Geant4

Geant4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter. Its areas of application include high energy, 
nuclear and accelerator physics, as well as studies in medical and space science.

## Event Generators

### Pythia8

PYTHIA is a program for the generation of high-energy physics events, i.e. for the description of collisions at high energies between elementary particles such as e+, e-, p and pbar in various combinations. It contains theory and models for a number of physics aspects, including hard and soft interactions, parton distributions, initial- and final-state parton showers, multiparton interactions, fragmentation and decay. It is largely based on original research, but also borrows many formulae and other knowledge from the literature.

### hepmc

The HepMC package is an object oriented event record written in C++ for High Energy Physics Monte Carlo Generators. Many extensions from HEPEVT, the Fortran HEP standard, are supported: the number of entries is unlimited, spin density matrices can be stored with each vertex, flow patterns (such as color) can be stored and traced, integers representing random number generator states can be stored, and an arbitrary number of event weights can be included. Particles and vertices are kept separate in a graph structure, physically similar to a physics event. The added information supports the modularisation of event generators. The package has been kept as simple as possible with minimal internal/external dependencies. Event information is accessed by means of iterators supplied with the package.

### herwig

Herwig is a multi-purpose particle physics event generator. It is built based on the experience gained with both the HERWIG 6 and Herwig++ 2 event generators. Continuing the Herwig++ 2 development, Herwig 7.0 (Herwig++ 3.0) replaces any prior HERWIG or Herwig++ versions. Herwig provides significantly improved and extended physics capabilities when compared to both its predecessors, HERWIG 6 and Herwig++ 2, while keeping the key model motivations such as coherent parton showers (including angular-ordered and dipole-based evolution), the cluster hadronization model, an eikonal multiple-interaction model, highly flexible BSM capabilities and improved perturbative input using next-to-leading order QCD.
